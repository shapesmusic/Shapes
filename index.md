### Skill Sets:

<strong style="color: purple;">Playing With Songs</strong>

<a href="../levels/01-a-shape" target="_blank">Level 1</a> introduces a shape. <a href="../levels/02-different-shapes" target="_blank">Level 2</a> and <a href="../levels/03-a-group" target="_blank">3</a> expand to a full group of shapes and give them names. <a href="../levels/06-playing-with-the-anchor" target="_blank">Level 6</a> introduces the anchor note as a way to structure what you play. <a href="../levels/08-matching-a-shape" target="_blank">Level 8</a> shows you how to figure out the shape on your own. <a href="../levels/09-notes-in-time" target="_blank">Level 9</a> introduces music notation. And <a href="../levels/11-groups-of-shapes" target="_blank">Level 11</a> introduces three additional groups of shapes that will occasionally show up in songs.

<strong style="color: blue;">Tactile Reading</strong>

<a href="../levels/04-shape-fingerings" target="_blank">Level 4</a> introduces a single fingering pattern that allows you to play hands together in any shape, starting on any note. <a href="../levels/12-reading-by-touch" target="_blank">Level 12</a> uses this pattern to begin reading a relative notation along with songs, in a way that feels like playing a rhythm game. <a href="../levels/18-reading-by-touch-2" target="_blank">Level 18</a> and <a href="../levels/23-reading-by-touch-3" target="_blank">23</a> expand the range of shapes and add features to the notation. <a href="../levels/27-making-time-relative" target="_blank">Level 27</a> replaces pulse dots with rhythmic note symbols. And <a href="../levels/30-incidentals" target="_blank">Level 30</a> gives a way to notate outside the shape.

<strong style="color: red;">Chord & Key Levels</strong>

<a href="../levels/05-the-anchor-note" target="_blank">Level 5</a> introduces the anchor note as a way of structuring the other notes of the shape. <a href="../levels/07-bass-notes" target="_blank">Level 7</a> shows that changing bass notes along with any other notes of a shape create the recognizable framework for a song. And <a href="../levels/10-changes" target="_blank">Level 10</a> introduces changing shapes, anchors, and bass notes.

<strong style="color: green;">Tonescapes & Tensions</strong> (audio)

<a href="../levels/13-a-tonescape-and-tensions" target="_blank">Level 13</a> introduces a tonescape, and recognition of the anchor, one note higher, and one note lower within the tonescape. <a href="../levels/15-two-higher-and-lower" target="_blank">Level 15</a> expands to two notes higher and lower. <a href="../levels/17-switch-to-number-names" target="_blank">Level 17</a> brings in octave equivalence and switches from higher/lower names to number names. <a href="../levels/19-moods" target="_blank">Level 19</a> and <a href="../levels/21-light-and-heavy-tensions" target="_blank">21</a> introduce different moods that result from the sum of tensions to the anchor. <a href="../levels/24-moods-and-tensions-together" target="_blank">Level 24</a>, <a href="../levels/25-getting-inside-of-moods" target="_blank">25</a>, and <a href="../levels/28-all-moods-and-tensions" target="_blank">28</a> expand to recognition of all moods and all tensions. And <a href="../levels/31-independent-solfege" target="_blank">Level 31</a> removes the tonescape.

<strong style="color: orange;">Reading Imagery</strong> (audio)

<a href="../levels/14-imagination-as-an-instrument" target="_blank">Level 14</a> introduces imagery, <a href="../levels/16-reading-by-ear" target="_blank">Level 16</a> uses notation to draw two additional notes out of the tonescape. <a href="../levels/20-reading-by-ear-2" target="_blank">Level 20</a> expands to three moods. <a href="../levels/22-reading-by-ear-3" target="_blank">Level 22</a>, <a href="../levels/26-reading-by-ear-4" target="_blank">26</a>, and <a href="../levels/29-mood-notes" target="_blank">29</a> expand to hearing all tensions in all moods. And <a href="../levels/32-free-play" target="_blank">Level 32</a> is free play imagery in all moods.
